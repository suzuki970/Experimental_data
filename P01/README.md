* *'Rscript'* is for the initialization and setting R environment. 
  * to set the R environment up, the packages described in *'initilization.R'* (they are commented out) need to be installed.
* *'Rscript_data_analysis'* is for analyzing and generating the figures. 
  * EEG data and Pupil data are saved as "dat_xxx.mat" in *'matData'*.
